*Makes 3 12 inch pizza crusts*
*prep. time ~45 min to 1 hr*

* 1 Tbsp active dry yeast (1 oz)
* 1 1/2 cup warm water
* 3 1/2 cup flour
* 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* pinch of salt


1. Dissolve Yeast in warm water. Let sit until foaming about 5 min. ( I didn't get the foaming action but the dough still rose)
2. Sift flour into large bowl. Make a hole in the center of the mounded flour.
3. Add oil and salt to hole in center of flour
4. Pour yeast water mixture into center of flour
5. Use spatula to draw ingredients together.
6. Mix with your hands to from a dough.
7. Knead dough while adding more flour until dough is no longer sticky
8. Cover dough with towel and put in a warm place to rise. Let rise until double. ( I put it in the oven of warm for ~30 min.)
9. After dough has risen, punch it down to remove air bubbles.
10. On a lightly floured surface take a third of the dough and roll out flat. Shape into a thin round crust with your hands.
11. Cover with favorite toppings.
12. Bake at 450-500 deg. Farenheit for about 10-12 min. I find this results in a crisp crust.
