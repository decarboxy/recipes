   * 1 lb. sirloin beef
   * 1/4 cup soy sauce
   * 1 tbsp hoisin sauce
   * 1 tbsp sesame oil
   * 2 tbsp sugar
   * 2-3 cloves chopped garlic
   * 3-4 green onions, chopped
   * 1:1 mixture of cornstarch and water (probably about 4 tbsp of total mixture needed for dish)
   * 1 tbsp peanut oil

   - In a small bowl, whisk soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and garlic.
   - Add cubed pieces of beef to the bowl and toss to coat.
   - Marinate beef for 30 minutes.
   - Heat up peanut oil in skillet over medium heat.
   - Add beef mixture, but reserve the remaining soy sauce liquid in the bowl.  Try to scoop up just the beef in order to cook the beef quickly.
   - Once the beef is fully cooked, lower the heat slightly (a little less than medium but not fully low heat) and add the remaining soy sauce mixture.
   - Stir to coat, and add the 1:1 cornstarch/water mixture until the sauce thickens.
   - After the sauce thickens, add the green onion and stir.

Notes:
   * We like to add stir-fried vegetables to this dish, so it's a  mixture of beef and vegetables.  So when we do that, we stir-fry the vegetables first, set it aside when done, and then start cooking the beef.  We'll add the vegetables after the sauce has thickened, just to toss and coat the whole dish.
