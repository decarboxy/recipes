* 1 package Oreo
* 8 oz. Cream Cheese
* 2 cups of dipping chocolate. (We used two 7 oz cups of Baker's Dipping Chocoloate)

1. Powder all the Oreos. We crushed the Oreo's with a mallet in a plastic bag and then used a blender to further grind the cookies up.
2. Place powdered Oreos in a large bowl.
3. Divide the cream cheese into small hunks then add them to the Oreos.
4. Mix Oreos and Cream cheese by hand until homogeneous.
5. Form one inch or slightly smaller balls out of Oreo filling (~48 balls).
6. Place in fridge to harden. Takes ~30 mins to 1 hr
7. Melt Dipping Chocolate. (This can be done either by following the directions provided or by placing a meal bowl over a steaming pan of water.)
8. Dip harden Oreo balls into Chocolate.
9. As an option, with the chocolate still gooey, you can roll the truffle in chopped nuts, coconut flakes, or sprinkles.
10. Place Balls back into Fridge to cool and harden.
