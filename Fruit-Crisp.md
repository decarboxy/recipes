## Crisp topping 

1. Mix dry ingredients until well incorporated.
2. Melt butter completely.  Add to dry ingredients and mix until dough-like.
3. In a 9"x13" glass pan, grease pan.  Divide crisp topping into two halves.
4. Press down one half of crisp topping until it coats all of the pan.  Pack so that it makes a 1 piece layer.
5. Add the fruit on top of the bottom crust.
6. Take the remaining crisp and make a top crust over the fruit.
7. Bake at 350 F for about 30 minutes or until the fruit is bubbly and the crisp topping is brown.
