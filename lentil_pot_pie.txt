Makes 4 servings**


FILLING:
  * ½ cup brown lentils
  * 1/4 teaspoon salt
  * 1 tablespoon olive oil
  * 1 large onion, chopped
  * 2 carrots, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
  * 1 ½ teaspoons dried rosemary
  * ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
  * 1 large garlic clove, minced
  * 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
  * 2 cups vegetable broth
  * 3 medium or 9 baby Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
  * 4 teaspoons soy sauce
  * 1 tablespoon tomato paste

BISCUITS:
  * 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
  * 6 tablespoons yellow cornmeal
  * 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 4 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, diced
  * ½ cup buttermilk* (you can reconstitute dry buttermilk, or add 1tbsp vinegar to regular milk)
  * 1 teaspoon dried rosemary

To make FILLING:

Combine 3 cups cold water, lentils, and salt in medium saucepan; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid; set lentils and reserved liquid aside.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, and cook until browned, about 20 minutes. Add carrot, rosemary, and thyme, and sauté 4 minutes. Add garlic, and sauté 30 seconds. Reduce heat to medium-low. Mix flour into vegetables; cook 1 minute. Add vegetable broth and reserved lentil cooking liquid.

Mix in potatoes, soy sauce, and tomato paste. Cover; simmer until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, 13 to 15 minutes. Add lentils; season with salt and pepper. Divide filling among four 2-cup ovenproof bowls.

Filling can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; chill. Bring to room temperature before continuing.

To make TOPPING:

Preheat oven to 400° F. In a large bowl, mix together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. Add butter and rosemary, and blend with a pastry blender or fork until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add buttermilk, and mix with clean hands until dough forms moist clumps. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Divide into 4 equal pieces; shape each into 2/3-inch-thick disk. Set rounds atop filling.

Bake pies on baking sheet until tester inserted into biscuit topping comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
