*Serves 4, 3 points per serving* 

* 8 cups escarole leaves, chopped
* 4 slices uncooked turkey bacon
* 3 medium shallots, halved and thinly sliced
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* 1/4 cup water
* 1/4 tsp tabe salt
* 1/4 cup ground black pepper

Place escarole in a large serving bowl.

Cook turkey bacon in a large nonstick skillet over
mediumâ€”low heat, turning occasionally, until lightly
browned and crisp, about 5 to 6 minutes. Drain
bacon on paper towels and then tear or chop into
small pieces; set aside.

Add shallots and 2 tablespoons each of vinegar
and water to same skillet. Cook over medium
heat, until shallots are crisp, but tender, stirring
frequently, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining
2 tablespoons each of vinegar and water, oil, salt,

and pepper; stir and cook until heated through,
about 1 to 2 minutes.

Pour shallot sauce over escarole; add turkey

bacon and toss to mix and coat. Serve immediately.

Yields about 2 cups per serving.
