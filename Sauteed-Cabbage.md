* 1/2 head cabbage
* 1/4 cup butter (4 tbsp butter, all cut into 1 tbsp portions)
* About 1/4 cup soy sauce
* Pepper to taste

1. Slice cabbage into long strips.  
2. Melt 2 tbsp butter in skillet.
3. Add a small handful of cabbage once the butter is melted.  Stir to coat with butter and put a lid on the skillet to steam for 2 minutes.
4. Alternate between stirring and steaming.  Once the cabbage looks translucent, add in another small handful of cabbage and 1/2 tbsp butter with every batch of cabbage. 
5. Stir and steam with the lid, add cabbage and butter until all of the cabbage is translucent and cooked.
6. Add in splashes of soy sauce to taste.  Sprinkle pepper on top.

##Notes

* If you're not sure if the batch of cabbage is fully cooked, taste the cabbage; it should be translucent and taste more like the butter that it's coated in than the sulfuric cabbage :)
* I like to add in enough soy sauce so that the edges of the cabbage slices are brown.  I don't drown the dish in soy sauce, but I add enough to taste both the butter and soy sauce.
