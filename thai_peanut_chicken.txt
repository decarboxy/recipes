   * 2 tbsp sesame oil
   * 1 lb. chicken cut into strips
   * 2 tbsp minced ginger
   * 1/2 cup hoisin sauce
   * 1/2 cup peanut butter
   * 1/4 cup scallions

  - Heat oil and cook chicken.  Set aside in a bowl.
  - In a separate sauce pan, add peanut butter and wait until mostly melted before adding in hoisin sauce.  Cook until peanut butter has melted to incorporate with the hoisin sauce.  Add water and stir to thin out sauce (I tend to add 1.25 cups of water).  Add the ginger and stir.
  - Add chicken to the sauce and green onions, stir and serve.
