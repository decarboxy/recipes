SERVES 2 as main course, 4 as a side dish

  * 12-14 oz can chickpeas
  * 1/2 cup coriander/cilantro, lightly chopped
  * 1/4 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice (or substitute lime)
  * 1 shallot OR 1/3 cup purple onion, minced or diced
  * 3 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1/2 tsp. turmeric
  * 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper (or more - adjust according to desired spiciness)
  * 2+1/2 tsp. ground cumin
  * 1/2 tsp. ground coriander
  * 1/4 tsp. black pepper
  * 2 Tbsp. vegetarian fish sauce OR soy sauce (non-vegetarians: use 1+1/2 Tbsp. fish sauce)
  * 2 Tbsp. oil for stir-frying
  * optional: 3-4 Tbsp. coconut milk

Preparation:

  * Heat up a wok or frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 2 Tbsp. oil plus the shallots (or onion) and garlic. Stir-fry 1 minute.
  * Add all of the dry spices (except the pepper), plus whatever sauce you're using (fish, soy, or veg. fish sauce). Also add 1 Tbsp. water. Stir-fry together briefly.
  * Add the chickpeas and continue stir-frying until they are covered with the spice mixture and are nice and hot (about 5 minutes). If they become too dry, another Tbsp. water.
  * Remove from heat. Stir in the lemon juice, black pepper, and most of the fresh coriander. If desired, also stir in 3-4 Tbsp. coconut milk.
  * Do a taste-test. Adjust the salt level by adding a little more soy or fish sauce if not salty enough. If too salty, add another squeeze of lemon or lime juice.
  * Top with any remaining coriander and serve hot with rice. ENJOY!
