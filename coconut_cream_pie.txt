**Crust (for 9 inch pie plate):
**
  * 1 cup of flour
  * 1/2 cup COLD crisco
  * 1/4 cup COLD water
  * 1/2 teaspoon of salt

Mix gently in a bowl using your hands until the consistency is similar to cornmeal. Make a ball with the dough. Add a little flour to the outside of the dough ball and lay it on wax paper that has flour on it. Use a rolling pin (add flour to this too) to roll out the dough until it fits in the pie plate. (Lay something heavy on the sides of the wax paper or you will wrestle it to death). To transfer the dough to the pie plate, fold it in half or quarters and lay it in pie plate and unfold. Cut around the pie plate with a knife to remove excess dough. Pinch the edge of the crust with thumb and forefinger to make a decorative border. Poke some small holes in the bottom of the crust with a fork. Bake at 325 degrees F for approximately 20 minutes or until crust is slightly brown. Let pie crust cool to room temperature before adding filling.

**Filling:**
  * One package of instant vanilla pudding.
  * 1 cup coconut

Follow directions for using pudding as pie filling. Whip pudding for 2 minutes until it thickens and mix in 1 cup shredded coconut. Transfer filling to pie crust.
Topping:

  * 2 egg whites
  * 1 tablespoon powdered sugar
  * 1/4 cup coconut

Whip egg whites fast with hand mixer until they turn white and fluffy and until they can make a peak when you touch them. (about 2 minutes). Once they are fluffy, mix in powdered sugar and whip for a few seconds more. Top the pie filling with this mixture.
Sprinkle with coconut. Broil for a couple of minutes until the coconut browns. Watch it closely because it browns really fast!
