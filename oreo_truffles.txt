======Oreo Truffles======

   * 1 package Oreo
   * 8 oz. Cream Cheese
   * 2 cups of dipping chocolate. (We used two 7 oz cups of Baker's Dipping Chocoloate)

   - Powder all the Oreos. We crushed the Oreo's with a mallet in a plastic bag and then used a blender to further grind the cookies up.
   - Place powdered Oreos in a large bowl.
   - Divide the cream cheese into small hunks then add them to the Oreos.
   - Mix Oreos and Cream cheese by hand until homogeneous.
   - Form one inch or slightly smaller balls out of Oreo filling (~48 balls).
   - Place in fridge to harden. Takes ~30 mins to 1 hr
   - Melt Dipping Chocolate. (This can be done either by following the directions provided or by placing a meal bowl over a steaming pan of water.)
   - Dip harden Oreo balls into Chocolate.
   - As an option, with the chocolate still gooey, you can roll the truffle in chopped nuts, coconut flakes, or sprinkles.
   - Place Balls back into Fridge to cool and harden.
