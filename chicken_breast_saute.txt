==ingredients==
  * 1 spray cooking spray
  * 1/2 tsp table salt
  * 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
  * 2 tsp unsalted butter
  * 3 garlic cloves minced
  * 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
  * 10 medium black olives, sliced
  * 1 tbsp capers, rinsed, drained, and chopped

==directions==
  - Coat a large nonstick  skillet with cooking spry and heat over medium heat. Meanwhile, season the chicken with salt and pepper
  - Slip the chicken into the skillent and cook until golden brown, about 5 min. Flip and continue cooking just until the chicken is cooked through, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of one chicken breast registers 165 degrees F, about 3 min more.  Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside
  - Melt the butter in the same skillet and add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Stir over the heat for 30 sec
  - Stir in the olives and capers; pour in tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet
  - Reduce the heat to low and simmer slowly until just slightly reduced, about 3 min
  - Return the chicken and any accumulated juices to the skillet. Cook until just warmed through, about 2 min. 
  - Yields 1 chicken breast and about 1/2 cup sauce per serving.
