*this is a fairly traditional style recipe, its more marsala and coffee flavored, and less sweet and whipped-creamlike than what you would usually see at a resturaunt*

* 1 1/2 cups espresso
* 2 tsp sugar
* 4 egg yolks
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup marsala
* 1 lb mascarpone (Room tmp)
* 1 cup heavy cream
* about 40 ladyfinger cookies
* 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder

prepare the espresso and dissolve 2 tsp sugar in it.  Allow to cool to room temperature.

Beat egg yolks in a double boiler till they get fluffy, beat in sugar, and marsala.  transfer over a pan of boiling water, whisk until it thickens. 

in a separate bowl, mash up mascarpone, fold the custard (zabaglione) made above into the mascarpone, mix very thoroughly.

Whip the heavy cream, fold whipped cream into the zabaglione/cheese mix. beat until smooth.


Dip lady fingers in coffee one at a time, place in a single layer on the bottom of a 12x8 pan.   pour half the zabaglione over the cookies, add another layer, and then another layer of zabaglione.  Dust with cocoa powder.
