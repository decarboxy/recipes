Pizza Dough

Makes 3 12 inch pizza crusts
prep. time ~45 min to 1 hr

  * 1 Tbsp active dry yeast (1 oz)
  * 1 1/2 cup warm water
  * 3 1/2 cup flour
  * 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
  * pinch of salt


  - Dissolve Yeast in warm water. Let sit until foaming about 5 min. ( I didn't get the foaming action but the dough still rose)
  - Sift flour into large bowl. Make a hole in the center of the mounded flour.
  - Add oil and salt to hole in center of flour
  - Pour yeast water mixture into center of flour
  - Use spatula to draw ingredients together.
  - Mix with your hands to from a dough.
  - Knead dough while adding more flour until dough is no longer sticky
  - Cover dough with towel and put in a warm place to rise. Let rise until double. ( I put it in the oven of warm for ~30 min.)
  - After dough has risen, punch it down to remove air bubbles.
  - On a lightly floured surface take a third of the dough and roll out flat. Shape into a thin round crust with your hands.
  - Cover with favorite toppings.
  - Bake at 450-500 deg. Farenheit for about 10-12 min. I find this results in a crisp crust.
