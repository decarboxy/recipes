====== Rum Balls ======


  * 1/2 cup quick cooking Quaker Oats (my note - these are not instant oatmeal, they are quick-cooking oats)
  * 1/3 cup dark rum
  * 2 cups confectioners sugar
  * 2/3 cup flaked coconut
  * 2/3 cup ground pecans
  * 2/3 cup yellow raisins
  * 3 Tablespoons unsweetened cocoa 
  * 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
  * 6 Tablespoons butter, melted


Soak oatmeal in rum 1 hour.  If you fall asleep watching Deep Space Nine reruns or something, just slosh some more into the bowl in the morning to cover evaporation factor, and proceed.

Add all remaining ingredients.  Refrigerate until firm.

Roll into 1" balls & roll in regular sugar.  Store 2 days at room temperature in airtight container (at least).  They don't spoil easily.
