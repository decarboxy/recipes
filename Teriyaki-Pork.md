* 4 pork steaks, each weighing 125g (4½oz) or chops about 1 inch thick
* 4 tablespoons cornflour
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 4 tablespoons rice vinegar
* Handful of watercress

## Sauce
* 4 tablespoons sake
* 4 tablespoons mirin
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 4 tablespoons soy sauce 
* 50g (2oz) fresh ginger, peeled and grated (large piece - weigh it)

Take the meat out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before cooking. Dust the steaks with the cornflour. Heat a frying pan over a moderate/low heat and add the vegetable oil. Sauté the steaks for 3 minutes on each side, then reduce the heat and cover the pan with a lid to steam-cook for a further 5 minutes. 

Remove the lid and add all the ingredients for the teriyaki sauce. Shake the pan to coat the steaks evenly with the sauce and reduce it a little. Add the rice vinegar and stir the sauce. When pork is 170 degrees in the middle remove it to a plate and then reduce the sauce. Remove the steaks and cut them into bite-sized pieces (or not). Reduce sauce to glaze. Arrange the meat on individual plates, drizzle over the sauce and serve with a garnish of watercress.

This teriyaki cooking sauce works well with lamb chops. Serve with cauliflower miso gratin or leek and carrot mini frittatas.
