**Directions**
  - In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until browned. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
  - Season the beef with the Essence.
  - Add enough oil to the pan to equal 2 tablespoons of fat and heat over medium-high.
  - When hot, add the beef (in batches, if necessary to prevent overcrowding). Cook until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan.
  - Add the onions, adding more oil as needed. Cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.
  - Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
  - Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until wilted and starting to brown, 4 to 5 minutes.
  - Add the salt, pepper, flour, and Worcestershire, and stir well. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.
  - Add the beer and stock, and stir to deglaze the pan.
  - Bring to a boil
  - Add the bay leaf, parsley, and thyme, and return the meat to the pan.
  - Lower the heat, cover, and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender, about 1 hour.
  - Remove from the heat, discard the bay leaf, and adjust the seasoning, to taste.
  - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
  - Roll out the pastry crust on a lightly floured surface into a circle large enough to cover the top of the baking dish.
  - Add the cooked bacon to the meat mixture.
  - Pour into a large, round, deep-dish, ceramic, baking pan.
  - Place the pastry crust on top of the baking dish, crimping around the sides to seal.
  - Cut a vent hole in the center with a small sharp knife.
  - Brush with the beaten egg and bake until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.
