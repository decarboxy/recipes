Set the bowl in a warm, draft-free place (such as a turned-off oven) for about 5 minutes. or until the mixture almost doubles in volume.

Meanwhile. drain the fruit. reserving the rum, and carefully pat the pieces completely dry with paper towels. Place the fruit in a bowl, sprinkle it with 2 tablespoons of the flour. and turn it about with a spoon until the flour is completely absorbed. Set aside.

Knead the dough, by pushing it down with the heels of your hands. pressing it inward and folding it back on itself. Continue the kneading for about 15 minutes, or until all the flour is incorporated and the dough is smooth and elastic. Flour your hands lightly from time to time. Now press the fruit and almonds into the dough, 1/3 cup or so at a time. but do not knead or handle it too much or the dough will discolor. coat a deep bowl with 1 teaspoon of melted butter and drop in the dough. Brisj the top of the dough With another 2 teaspoons of melted hotter. drape a towel over the bowl and set it in a warm, draft-free place for 2. hours, or until the dough doubles in bulk

Punch the dough down and divide it into two equal pieces. Let them test for 10 minutes, then roll the pieces out into strips ahout 12 inches long, 8 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick. Brush each strip with 2 tables pones of the remainting butter and springle each with 2 tablespoonds of the remaining sugar. Fold each strip lengthwise in the following fashion: one long side over to the center of the strip and press the edge down lightly. Then fold the other long side across it. overlapping the seam down the center by about 1 inch. Press the edge gently to keep it in place. With lightly floured hands, taper the ends of the load slightly and pat the sides gently together to
mound it in the center. The finished loaf should be about 3 1/2 to 4 inches wide and 13 inches long.

With a pastry brush, and 1 tablespoon of melted butter, coat the bottom of an 11 by 17 inch jelly roll pan. Place the loaves on hte pan and brush them with the remaining 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Set the loaves
