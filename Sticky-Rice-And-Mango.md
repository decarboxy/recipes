* 2 cups rice
* 2 3/4 cups water
* 1-2 ripe mangos, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 can coconut milk (8 oz.)
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 3/4 tsp coconut flavoring
* 3/4 tsp vanilla
* 2 tbsp cornstarch dissolved into 2 tbsp water

1. Soak the rice in 2 cups water for 20 minutes.
2. Steam rice in a pot by adding 3/4 cup water to the rice+water mixture from step 1.  Add 1/2 can coconut milk, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp coconut flavoring, and 1 tbsp brown sugar.
3. Stir into the rice, lifting any rice grains that have stuck to the bottom of the pot.
4. Bring to a gentle boil, then partially cover with a lid.  Turn the heat down to medium low.
5. Allow to simmer for 20 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed by the rice.
6. Remove the pot from the heat, place the lid on tight, and leave to steam cook for another 5-10 min.
7. To make the sauce, warm the rest of the can of coconut milk together with 3 tbsp sugar, a pinch of salt, 3/4 tsp coconut flavoring, and 3/4 tsp vanilla flavoring over medium heat for 5 minutes.
8. Add cornstarch/water to the sauce and stir to thicken it slightly.  Turn down heat to low as it thickens.
10. Scoop rice onto a plate, arrange mangoes to the side, and spoon sauce over rice and mangoes.
