  *1/4 cup Mayonnaise
  *1 cup crushed Cornflakes
  *1/2 cup Flour
  *Various seasonings: (Typical: Salt, Pepper, Garlic Powder, Cumin, Paprika, Chili Powder, Dill)
  *2 lbs Chicken

  - Take flour and add in various seasonings.  Mix up thoroughly and set aside in a small bowl.
  - Crush cornflakes in a 1 gallon ziplock bag.
  - Pound and cut chicken into little nugget strips and set aside.
  - Make a small assembly line of shallow bowls: 1st shallow bowl should contain chicken nuggets, 2nd shallow bowl should contain mayonnaise, 3rd shallow bowl should contain some of the crushed cornflakes and seasoned flour mixed up (Keep ratio 2:1).
  - Drag chicken across mayonnaise, lightly covering chicken, and then dip into cornflake/flour mixture.
  - Place on greased cookie sheet.
  - Spray chicken coating with non-stick spray (this will make the shell crisp up).
  - Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees Farenheit.
  - Cook chicken for 20 minutes.  To tell when the chicken is done, cut thickest piece and juices should run clear and meat should be fully white.
