2. Crush cornflakes in a 1 gallon ziplock bag.
3. Pound and cut chicken into little nugget strips and set aside.
4. Make a small assembly line of shallow bowls: 1st shallow bowl should contain chicken nuggets, 2nd shallow bowl should contain mayonnaise, 3rd shallow bowl should contain some of the crushed cornflakes and seasoned flour mixed up (Keep ratio 2:1).
5. Drag chicken across mayonnaise, lightly covering chicken, and then dip into cornflake/flour mixture.

7. Spray chicken coating with non-stick spray (this will make the shell crisp up).
