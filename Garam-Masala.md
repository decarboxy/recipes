* 1 tbsp cardamom seeds (if you can't buy the seeds then buy cardamom pods and shell them yourself)
* 1 tsp black peppercorns
* 1 tsp black cumin seeds (you can use regular cumin seeds if black aren't available)
* 1 tsp whole cloves
* 1/3 of a whole nutmeg (you can break a whole nutmeg by placing it on a cloth and bashing it with a meat mallet or rolling pin) 
* a medium stick of cinnamon, about 5-8cm/2-3 inches, broken up into 3-4 pieces

Combine all ingredients in a coffee grinder and grind as fine as possible
