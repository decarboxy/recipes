# recipes
A gollum wiki for storing recipes

This wiki is hosted at http://recipes.decarboxy.com

to add a recipe:

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your recipe as a markdown file
3. Add a link to the new file to Home.md
4. Open a PR

After the PR is merged, the changes should be propagated within about a minute

## More detailed instructions

Click the fork button at the top right of the screen. When prompted, make the fork into your own account.  You then have two options:

1. you can clone your newly forked repository, make edits on your computer and then push the changes
2. you can click the + button at the top of the file listing, make a new file, and edit it directly in the web browser

In either case, files must end with ```.md```. One recipe for file, in the root directory of the repository.

The name of the file becomes the title of the page, so Ham-Sandwich.md will be a document with the title "Ham Sandwich".  You don't need to include the recipe heading in the document. 

Make sure to add a link in Home.md for every recipe file.

When you've made all the changes you want, create a pull request by following these instructions: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

There's no particular need for a lengthy pull request message, this is just a recipe wiki
