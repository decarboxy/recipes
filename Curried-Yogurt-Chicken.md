* 1 Tbsp [[Ghee]] *or vegetable oil, but ghee is way better for this*
* 1 cup sliced onion
* 1/4 cup minced ginger root
* 2 Tbsp minced garlic
* 1 tbsp sliced serrano chile pepper
* 1 tbsp [[recipes:garam_masala|garam masala]]
* 2 Tbsp curry powder
* 6 oz mango or peach yogurt
* 4 chicken hindquarters, skinned and trimmed (2-3 lb total)

Heat ghee in a large skillet, add onion and saute till browned (3-5 minutes).  add ginger, garlic and serrano, and saute 2 minutes (don't burn the garlic).  add curry powder and garam masala, saute 1 minute.  Remove mixture from heat, spoon into a food processor, let cool for 5-10 minutes and add yogurt.  Food process till smooth.

Mix marinade with chicken and marinate for 4-8 hours.  

Prepare grill for indirect grilling, if a gas grill, keep one side unlit, if a charcoal grill, pile coals on one side.  Grill 20 minutes a side on the unlit side of the grill.  Cook until chicken reaches 175 on an instant read thermometer. 

the marinade has a lot of protein and sugar in it, so if you don't do the indirect grilling thing and try to cook this directly over the coals you'll burn the chicken really quickly

(what you're doing here is pretending you have a tadoori oven so if you have one i guess you could use that)
