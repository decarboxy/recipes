* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or ghee, plus more for drizzling
* 1 small onion, thinly sliced
* 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 2 teaspoon thyme leaves
* 1 bay leaf
* 8 small zucchini (3 pounds), thinly sliced, plus long zucchini shavings for garnish
* Kosher salt
* 3 cups water
* 2 tablespoons finely shredded basil
* 2 cups ice
* Freshly ground pepper
* 2 cups purslane or baby arugula

In a large saucepan, heat the 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the onion and garlic and cook over moderate heat until translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir in the thyme and bay leaf and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the sliced zucchini, season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Add the water and bring to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Discard the bay leaf and stir in the shredded basil.

Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender until very smooth. Transfer the zucchini puree to a large bowl. Stir in the ice. Refrigerate the zucchini soup for at least 3 hours, until thoroughly chilled.
Season the soup with salt and pepper. Ladle into shallow bowls and top with a small handful of purslane and zucchini shavings. Drizzle with olive oil and serve.

MAKE AHEAD The zucchini soup can be refrigerated for up to 1 day.
