* 1 spray cooking spray
* 1/2 tsp table salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 2 tsp unsalted butter
* 3 garlic cloves minced
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
* 10 medium black olives, sliced
* 1 tbsp capers, rinsed, drained, and chopped
* 14oz canned diced tomatoes


1. Coat a large nonstick  skillet with cooking spry and heat over medium heat. Meanwhile, season the chicken with salt and pepper
2. Slip the chicken into the skillet and cook until golden brown, about 5 min. Flip and continue cooking just until the chicken is cooked through, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of one chicken breast registers 165 degrees F, about 3 min more.  Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside
3. Melt the butter in the same skillet and add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Stir over the heat for 30 sec
4. Stir in the olives and capers; pour in tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet
5. Reduce the heat to low and simmer slowly until just slightly reduced, about 3 min
6. Return the chicken and any accumulated juices to the skillet. Cook until just warmed through, about 2 min. 
7. Yields 1 chicken breast and about 1/2 cup sauce per serving.
