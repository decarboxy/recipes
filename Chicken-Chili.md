In a large non-stick frying pan, fry:

* 2 onions, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, chopped
* 2 Tablespoons vegetable oil

until golden.

Add and fry for a few minutes until the chicken is somewhat browned and spices are fragrant:

* 2 Tablespoons chili powder
* 1 Tablespoon whole cumin seeds
* 1 Tablespoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon sea salt
* 1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken, chopped up

Add:

* 2 14-ounce cans of diced tomatoes
* 19 ounce can of black beans, drained and rinsed

Stir is all up, bring it to a simmer and transfer to the crockpot. Cook on low (slowcookers have heat settings of high and low), for 4-8 hours. Adjust the seasoning with a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar if necessary.
