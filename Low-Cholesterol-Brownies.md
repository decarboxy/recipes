* 1 cup applesauce
* 1 cup milk
* 2 cups flour
* 2 cups sugar
* 1/3 cup cocoa powder
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp vanilla


1. Mix together all dry ingredients on a bowl and mixed well.
2. Add in wet ingredients and mix.
3. Pour into a greased 9"x13" cookie sheet.
4. Bake at 350 F for 25 minutes.  Batter will cook faster, so watch to make sure brownies are not dried out.

Notes:

* To get any semblance of taste onto the brownies, ice with whipped chocolate frosting and top with nuts.  Instead of having a really rich brownies, these are lower in cholesterol and most of the taste is in the frosting, so it's the right amount of sweetness.
