====== Zucchini Mini Muffins ======
  * 4 spray(s) cooking spray   
  * 2 small uncooked zucchini   
  * 1 cup(s) all-purpose flour   
  * 1/2 cup(s) whole-grain wheat flour   
  * 1/4 cup(s) sugar, granulated   
  * 2 tsp baking powder   
  * 1/2 tsp ground ginger   
  * 1/2 tsp table salt
  * 2 large egg white(s)   
  * 2/3 cup(s) low-fat milk   
  * 1/4 cup(s) packed brown sugar, dark-variety   
  * 1/4 cup(s) walnut oil, or almond oil   
  * 2 tsp vanilla extract    

Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 400Â°F. Coat two 12 indentation mini muffin tins with cooking spray.

Grate zucchini through the large holes of a box grater into a colander in the sink; squeeze out excess moisture by pressing down with a spoon.

In a large bowl, whisk together both flours, granulated sugar, baking powder, ground ginger and salt.

In a second bowl, whisk together zucchini, egg white, milk, brown sugar, oil and vanilla extract until sugar is mostly dissolved (might still be a little grainy).

Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients; stir with a wooden spoon just until there are no pockets of dry flour in the mixture. Spoon batter into prepared muffin tins, about 2 tablespoons per indentation.

Bake until browned, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 12 to 14 minutes. Cool in tin for a couple of minutes before turning muffins out and cooling them on a wire rack. Yields 1 muffin per serving.
