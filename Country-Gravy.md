* 1 tbsp flour
* 1/4 tsp salt/pepper
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 2 cups Milk
* 2 tbsp Butter

1. Mix flour with salt, pepper, garlic sprinkled in until you can see the flakes throughout.  Set aside.
2. Melt a tablespoon of butter.  When melted, incorporate flour mixture in, whisking until butter is absorbed.  If butter is not absorbed, add more flour until roux is formed.
3. Cook roux until browned.
4. Lower temperature and slowly add milk and whisk until incorporated.  Add milk slowly until gravy has reached desired texture.
