Ingredients (16 pieces)

  * 2 10-ounce blocks of firm tofu

Ingredients for filling(16 pieces)

  * 10 ounces shrimp. peeled,deveined, and coarsely ground or chopped (or 50% shrimp and 50% ground pork)
  * 1 scallion (white and green parts), finely minced
  * 1 teaspoon salt
  * 2 teaspoons rice wine or dry sherry
  * 1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
  * 1 teaspoon cornstarch

Ingredients for sauce

  * 1/3 cup chicken stock or water
  * 1 teaspoon soy sauce
  * 2 teaspoons oyster sauce
  * 1/2 teaspoon sugar
  * 1/2 teaspoon black bean and garlic sauce
  * 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch dissolved in 1 tablespoon water

Instruction

Put the sauce ingredients together and cook over medium heat until the sauce bubbles and thickens.

In a medium bowl, combine and mix well:
  * 10 oz. shrimp. peeled,deveined, and coarsely ground or chopped (
or 50% shrimp and 50% ground pork)
  * 1 scallion (white and green parts), finely minced
  * 1 tsp. salt
  * 2 tsp. rice wine or dry sherry
  * 1/8 tsp. ground white pepper
  * 1 tsp. cornstarch

Cut each block of tofu in half along a narrow side to from 2
squares, each about 3X3X3/4 inches. Cut each square from corner to
corner in an X-shape to from 4 triangles. Repeat with the remaining
squares, making 16 triangles in all. Pat the tofu dry with a paper
towel.

Cut out a thin pocket along the long side of the triangle.

Place 2 teaspoons of the filling into each pocket, being careful
not to break the tofu.

Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; then add 1 tablespoon
oil. When it is almost smoking, place several pieces of tofu, one
filled side down, into the skillet. Do not crowd. Turn the tofu to
brown all sides, starting with the filling sides, and cooking for 5 to
6 minutes total. Make the sauce and drizzle it over the tofu. Serve
hot.
